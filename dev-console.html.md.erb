Apps Manager is a web-based tool to help manage organizations, spaces, applications, services, and users. Apps Manager provides a visual interface for performing a subset of functions available through the cf Command Line Interface (CLI):

* **Orgs**: You can create, manage, and delete orgs.
* **Spaces**: You can create, manage, and delete spaces.
* **Apps**: You can scale apps, bind apps to services, manage environment variables and routes, view logs and usage information, start and stop apps, and delete apps.
* **Services**: You can bind services to apps, unbind services from apps, choose and edit service plans, and rename and delete service instances.
* **Users**: You can invite new users, manage user roles, and delete users.


Your ability to perform actions in Apps Manager depends on your <%=vars.console_ev%>.


What you can do with Apps Man depends on your role. 
However, depending on your <%=vars.console_ev%>, you might be able to perform certain org and space management actions on the Apps Manager.

The table below shows the relationship between specific org and space management
actions that you can perform and the users that can perform these actions.

Note that:

* Admins can use either the CLI or the Apps Manager to perform these actions.
* Org Managers, like Admins, can perform all actions using the Apps Manager.
* Space Managers, like Admins and Org Managers, can assign and remove users from
spaces using the Apps Manager.
* Apps Manager users of any role can create an org and view org and space users.

This topic discusses how to view and manage spaces, as well as how to manage apps and service instances associated with a space.


Complete the following steps to invite new users to the Apps Manager.

1. Log in to the Apps Manager. <%=vars.console_3%>

1. The Apps Manager displays information for your org and all of the spaces in your org.

	![Select Org]( <%=vars.console_org %> )








1. In the Members tab, click **Invite New Members**. The **Invite New Team Member(s)** form appears.

	![Members]( <%=vars.org_members %> )

1. Add an email address, assign a team role or roles, then click **Send Invite** to invite a new user to join your org.

	![Invite]( <%=vars.invite_members %> )

## <a id='known-issues'></a>Important Tips ##

* You can remove users from orgs, but not spaces.
Instead, revoke the user's permissions in all spaces to effectively remove the
user from the org.
* Not all of the Apps Manager pages are Ajax-enabled.
Refresh the page to see the latest information.
* Changes to environment variables, as well as service bindings and unbindings,
require a `cf restage` to update the application.
