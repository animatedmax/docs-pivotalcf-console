title: Organizations, Spaces, Roles, and Permissions
---

Cloud Foundry uses role-based access control (RBAC), with each role granting
permissions in either an organization or an application space.

## <a id='organizations'></a>Organizations ##

An organization, or org, consists of users grouped together for management
purposes.
All member of an org share a resource quota plan, services availability, and
custom domains and routes.

## <a id='spaces'></a>Spaces ##

All applications and services are scoped to an application space, or app space.
Each org contains at least one app space.
An app space provides a set of users access to a shared space for application
development, deployment, and maintenance.
Each app space role applies only to a particular app space.
By default, the org manager has app space manager permissions for all spaces
within the organization.

## <a id='roles'></a>Roles and Permissions ##

A user can have one or more roles.
The combination of these roles defines the userâ€™s overall permissions in the org
and within specific app spaces in that org.
