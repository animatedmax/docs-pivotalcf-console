## <a id='known-issues'></a> Known Issues and Important Tips ##

This version of the Developer Console includes the following known issues:

 * User page performance can be slow when there are multiple users.
 * You can remove users from organizations, but not spaces. Instead, revoke the user's permissions in a space to effectively remove the user.
 * Console pages are not Ajax-enabled and sometimes show the wrong application status as a result. Refresh the page to see the latest information.
 * Changes to environment variables, as well as service bindings and unbindings, require a `cf push` to update the application.
 * You cannot resend an email invitation to join an organization. Instead, delete the user and send a new invitation.
