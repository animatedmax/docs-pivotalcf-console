title: Managing User Permissions Using the Developer Console
---

The Developer Console uses role-based access control, with each role granting
permissions in either an organization or an application space.
A user can have one or more roles.
The combination of these roles defines the userâ€™s overall permissions in the org
and within specific app spaces in that org.

Using the Developer Console, an administrator can manage user roles in orgs and
spaces.

For more information, see [Organizations, Spaces, Roles, and Permissions](../concepts/roles.html).
