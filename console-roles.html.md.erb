title: Managing User Permissions Using the Apps Manager
---

<strong><%= modified_date %></strong>

The Apps Manager uses role-based access control, with each role granting
permissions in either an organization or an application space.
A user can have one or more roles.
The combination of these roles defines the userâ€™s overall permissions in the org
and within specific app spaces in that org.

An administrator can manage user roles in orgs and spaces using the Apps Manager.

To see which permissions each role grants, see [Organizations, Spaces, Roles, and Permissions](../concepts/roles.html).
